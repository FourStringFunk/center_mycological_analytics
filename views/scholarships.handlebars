<h1>Scholarship 
Application</h1>
<br>
<p>​​Scholarships are our form of financial assistance and are intended to help 
  students pursue continuing education and advance their career goals. 
  However, not all students have equal access to financial resources to 
  fund their education, which is why scholarships are often awarded to students
  who are considered financially disadvantaged.</p>
