    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p>We are a community of leaders, researchers, and citizen scientists with
      the mission of providing educational resources around the burgeoningÂ 
      interest in mushrooms, their ecosystems, metabolisms, and human
      interactions.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to build a foundation for the next generation by breaking
      down barriers in scientific spaces while creating digestible procedures
      for our community to utilize.</p>
    <p>We have a history of innovation in mushroom analytics, supporting award
      winning cultivators, and building conversation platforms. From developing
      the Hyphae Spectrum to building out ISO accredited labs and culture spaces
      across the country, our team of instructors is dedicated to sharing their
      experience, insight, and expertise.</p>
