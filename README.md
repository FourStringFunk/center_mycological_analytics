# CENTER FOR MYCOLOGICAL ANALYTICS

## DESCRIPTION
Repo for the redesign of the Center for Mycological Analytics website and database.

### USER STORY
AS the owner of the Center for Mycological Analytics, I WANT a website that will showcase and allow users to sign-up for my certificate programs and allow me to manage student demographic, financial, registration and matriculation information using a custom database. The UI/UX should be simpler and more intuitive than our current site, driving the user toward three actions: register for a certificate, apply for a scholarship, and contact us for more information.

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
The dev team will use everything we've learned over the past six modules to create a real-world full-stack application based on the following acceptance criteria:

- Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API
- Use Handlebars.js as the template engine
- Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database
- Have both GET and POST routes fore retrieving and adding new data
- Use at lease one new library or package not discussed during the DU Full Stack Bootcamp class
- Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm
- Include authentication (express-session and cookies)
- Protect all API keys and sensitive information with environment variables
- Deploy using Heroku (with data)
- Have a responsive, polished, and interactive UI
- Meet good-quality coding standards
- Have a professional README
