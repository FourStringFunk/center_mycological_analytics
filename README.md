# CENTER FOR MYCOLOGICAL ANALYTICS

## DESCRIPTION
Repo for the redesign of the Center for Mycological Analytics website and database.

### USER STORY
AS the owner of the Center for Mycological Analytics, I WANT a website that will showcase and allow users to sign-up for my certificate programs and allow me to manage student demographic, financial, registration and matriculation information using a custom database. The UI/UX should be simpler and more intuitive than our current site, driving the user toward three actions: register for a certificate, apply for a scholarship, and contact us for more information.

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
The dev team will use everything we've learned over the past six modules to create a real-world full-stack application based on the following acceptance criteria:

- Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API
- Use Handlebars.js as the template engine
- Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database
- Have both GET and POST routes fore retrieving and adding new data
- Use at lease one new library or package not discussed during the DU Full Stack Bootcamp class
- Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm
- Include authentication (express-session and cookies)
- Protect all API keys and sensitive information with environment variables
- Deploy using Heroku (with data)
- Have a responsive, polished, and interactive UI
- Meet good-quality coding standards
- Have a professional README

## About the Project: Center for Mycological Analytics Website
The Center for Mycological Analytics is seeking to create a dynamic website that serves as a comprehensive platform for showcasing our certificate programs and facilitating user registrations. This project aims to enhance the overall user experience by providing a more streamlined and intuitive interface compared to our current website.

The new website should prioritize a user-centric design, guiding visitors towards three core actions:

Certificate Registration: Simplify the process for users to enroll in our certificate programs, making it convenient and straightforward.

Scholarship Applications: Provide a user-friendly application system for students to apply for scholarships, encouraging accessibility and inclusivity.

Contact and Information: Offer a clear and easily accessible means of communication for users to reach out to us, seeking additional information about our programs and services.

By creating a more intuitive and appealing user interface (UI/UX), the Center for Mycological Analytics aims to enhance user engagement and satisfaction. Through this project, we aspire to establish a cutting-edge online platform that showcases the excellence of our offerings and fosters a thriving educational community centered around mycology.
